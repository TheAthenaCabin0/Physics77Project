# All work to do
- Model gravitation between two bodies
> - Between stars and between stars and gas particles.\
~~- Animate gravitational attraction~~
~~- Model 2D movement and position~~
> - Use 4 values
> 1. X Pos, Y Pos
> 2. X Vel, Y Vel
- Animate 2D movement and position
- Figure out Angular Momentum
- Figure out friction + implement
- Model 1 particle
- Model N particles (in the range of thousands)
- Create User Control
> - Code boxes for modifiable constants 
> - (Angular momentum and size of stars)
- Copy code from our model to end-user model.
